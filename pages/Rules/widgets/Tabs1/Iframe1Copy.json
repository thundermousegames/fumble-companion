Place the rest of the deck face down in a pile. <br />\n<img src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/7458a6_9945830c44eb4067973ca66a74307902~mv2.png\" />\n\n<h3>Goal<\/h3>\nThe goal of each round is to be the first player to get 3 vertical position pairs. A position pair is two cards of the same position right above / below each other as shown in the following figure.\n<br /><img src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/7458a6_a06ef4e733744131afc3396f8bb982c3~mv2.jpg\" />\n\n<h3>Play<\/h3>\n<p>\nThe first round, the youngest player goes first. The player takes a card from the top of the deck. If they can make a vertical pair, they can replace one of their cards to make the pair. The replaced card goes into a face-up disacrd pile.\nThe second player proceeds by either taking the top card from the discard pile OR picking from the top of the deck. If the player decides not to play the picked card, they discard it. \n<\/p>\n<p>\n<h3>Scoring<\/h3>\n<p>Once a player gets 3 vertical pairs, the card portion of the round is over. The winner of the round gets a chance to shoot the orange ball into the cup for 6 points (touchdown) and a white ball for 1 point (extra point). The loser of the round gets a single shot to score a field goal for three points.<\/p>\n<p><i>Be sure to use the Scoreboard!<\/i><\/p>\n\n<p>After the first round, the player who lost the previous round goes first.<\/p>\n<h3>Winning<\/h3> \n<p>\nThe first player to end a round with over 21 points is the winner. If both players have over 21 points, the highest score wins!\n<\/p>\n\n<\/div>",
